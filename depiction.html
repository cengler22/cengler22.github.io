    <h1>Depiction of Nick</h1>
    
    <div class="main">
      Nick can't be described as an outsider that others 
      <div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('emerson.png')">aspire to be</div> 
      or an outside that is 
      <div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('finn.jpg')">despicable</div>
      . Nick is classified as an outsider because of how cowardly he is
      not because of any separation from 
      <div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('autonomy.jpg')">societal norms</div>
      . This story teaches us that not every outsider fits into the two categories of admirable or despicable.
      Nick's actions shouldn't be admired because the feeling of cowardice resides inside most people, so he is not unique. Nick 
      is a situational outsider, which is the same for most people. Depending on what setting certain people are in, they can be considered more or less of an outsider. Another thing
      that makes Nick's representation of outsider traits different from other notable outsiders is that most readers can relate to his feelings of cowardice or fear 
      because of 
      <div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('tent.jpg')">this particular setting</div>. 
      In some stories about outsiders, they have a completely separate view of reality from the rest of society, but in this case, Nick is in a relatable state of mind 
      based on his situation.
