    <h1>Outsider Comparison</h1>
    
    <div class="main">
      Nick being a coward can relate to the main character from 
      <u><div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('cuckoo.jpg')">The One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest</div></u>
      , 
      <div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('bromden.jpg')">Chief Bromden</div>
      . Bromden shows that he 
      is scared of normal routines in the hospital wards throughout the book. This is similar to how Nick is scared of normal noises in the woods, such 
      as bushes blowing in the wind. Each of them are scared of something that is considered normal by the majority of society, which makes them an outsider 
      in their respective situations.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Nick cannot be related to 
      <div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('finn.jpg')">Finn</div>
      from 
      <u><div class="highlight" onclick="Highlight('finn_book.jpg')">Finn</div></u>
      . They completely contrast each other. Nick is eager to please and means well, whereas Finn is 
      not looking to make anyone happy. Instead, Finn goes out of his way to cause trouble and very little will cause him to stop. Finn is racist, violent, 
      and vile, but Nick is innocent. This is a good example of the many categories of outsiders. One is an outsider because of normal human behavior among
      among others who don't express the same feelings, the other is an outsider because he was cast out from society due to his toxic personality.
